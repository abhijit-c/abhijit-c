# About Me

I'm Abhijit Chowdhary (Abhi)!

I'm a Ph.D. student in computational mathematics. 
My research interests lie in wielding math to design algorithms for real-world problems.
Towards that end, I'm currently focused on large-scale uncertainty quantification tasks.
My Ph.D. research was in that direction, doing so for infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems.
My goal is to develop scalable algorithms to quantify, analyze, and control the uncertainty inherent in models.
Also, if I get to play with huge computers along the way, all the better.
